# DreamWalker
Using a non‚Äêinvasive method (EEG) to access brain signals, we can harness generative AI, deep learning, and large language models to usher human communication into a new era of telecpathic communications.

Is vocal coads, facial features and hand jesters the only method of expressing thoughts and emotion?
I beleve that human brain is capable more than what we can precive. 
And at somepoint in history along evolution i beleve that humans had a 6th sence that could communicate with each other and with the lack of usage it has been detoriated.

Are vocal cords, facial features, and hand gestures the only methods of expressing thoughts and emotions?
The human brain is capable of more than what we can perceive. 
At some point in history, along with evolution, I believe humans had a sixth sense that could communicate with each other, and due to a lack of usage, it has deteriorated.
Using EEG signals to reconstruct visual neuro information may uncover new breakthroughs in cerebrum activities.

AI can help us decode the EEG signals using the ground truth data and reconstruct them.
